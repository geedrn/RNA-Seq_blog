    "body": "Aim for this page Know what kind of databases in expression analysis are available Quick answer of this page: Raw=SRA, Processed=GEO I want you to recoginie two important databases, SRA and GEO. Typical differences of the 2 databases: Aspect SRA (Sequence Read Archive) GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) Purpose Raw sequence data repository Functional genomics data repository Data type Raw sequencing data (fastq, bam) Processed data, metadata, and raw data links Scope All sequencing platforms and applications Primarily gene expression data, but includes other functional genomics data Data size Typically larger files (raw data) Usually smaller files (processed data) Search capability Sequence-based searches Expression and metadata-based searches SRA description: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/docs/ GEO description: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/info/overview.html Databases are linked to each other GSE275240 is our lab’s previous paper’s data accession ID. This GSE275240 is connected to another database called BioProject under PRJDB15620. BioProject contains SRA Run as sequence data and BioSample to explain what each sequence data is derived from. Certainly. SRA ‘Experiment’ describes the sequencing library derived from a specific sample and the sequencing method used. Much of the publicly available information about the data is recorded in the Experiment. SRA ‘Run’ is an object that groups together data files that should be linked to an Experiment. It contains little descriptive information about the data itself. All data files listed in a Run are merged into an SRA file for archiving (and into fastq files for distribution). Database structure This is an overall structure of SRA/BioSample/BioProject. The picture below is cited from DDBJ. Since it does not contain GEO, I just added in a mermaid plot. BioProject is a database designed to organize research projects and their associated data. By citing the BioProject accession number, data can be grouped on a project-by-project basis.

DRA (DDBJ Sequence Read Archive) is an archive of raw read sequences and maintained by DDBJ. DRA (DDBJ Sequence Read Archive) is a member of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) and is operated in international cooperation with NCBI SRA and EBI Sequence Read Archive (ERA). The data is mirrored (synchronized). If you can find the same dataset in SRA and DRA, downloading from DRA is geographically much faster."

    "body": "Aim for this page Know NCBI’s service: auto-generated RNA-seq count data Quick answer of this page: Use NCBI generates RNA-seq count data You are very fortunate. NCBI launched a new service to make the count matrix of RNA-Seq available! Count data generation occurs under the following conditions: 1. The sample is registered in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) 2. The sample is registered in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) 3. The sample is derived from either human or mouse A count matrix is automatically generated approximately one week after sample registration. For each GEO Series, two main types of files are generated, raw counts and normalized counts. RNA-seq Raw Count Matrix: Aspect Description Format Tab-delimited text file Purpose Suitable for input into differential expression analysis tools like DESeq2, edgeR, or limma voom Structure - First column: Gene IDs (matching the Human gene annotation table)- Remaining columns: Raw counts for each GEO Sample RNA-seq Normalized Count Matrix: Aspect Description Format Tab-delimited text file Purpose Suitable for qualitative analysis and visualization of gene expression abundance Structure - First column: Gene IDs (matching the Human gene annotation table)- Remaining columns: Normalized counts for each GEO Sample Normalization FPKM (RPKM) and TPM How does the analysis work? NCBI uses HISAT2 and featureCounts. Details are here. Briefly, SRA runs where the organism is Homo sapiens and type is Transcriptomic are aligned to genome assembly GCA_000001405.15 using HISAT2. Runs that pass a 50% alignment rate are further processed with Subread featureCounts which outputs a raw count file for each run. For Human data, the Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109.20190905 was used for gene annotation. GEO further processes these SRR raw count files into GEO Series raw counts matrices. Data derived from single cell samples are skipped. In cases where there is more than one SRA run per GEO Sample, the raw counts are summed. Values in the raw count matrices are rounded so that they are compatible input for common differential expression analysis software. Using the raw counts as input, GEO then computes FPKM(RPKM) and TPM normalized values. This way of the output is Atarimae (natural) in RNA-Seq field Please note that our in-house RNA-Seq pipeline provides the same format of results. You need to handle these data by yourself for data exploration anyway."
