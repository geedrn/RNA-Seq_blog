    "body": "Aim for this page Understand methods of normalization in RNA-Seq Quick answer of this page: Use TPM first Before discussing this topic, this QA is must-read! RPKM and FPKM are virtually the same concept. RPKM is basically for single-end sequencing and FPKM is for pair-end sequencing. With paired-end RNA-seq, two reads can correspond to a single fragment, or, if one read in the pair did not map, one read can correspond to a single fragment. The only difference between RPKM and FPKM is that FPKM takes into account that two reads can map to one fragment (and so it doesn’t count this fragment twice). For RPKM (Reads Per Kilobase Million): \\[\\text{RPKM} = \\frac{\\text{Number of reads mapped to a gene}}{\\text{Total reads in sample} \\times 10^{-6}} \\times \\frac{10^3}{\\text{Length of gene in bp}}\\] For FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase Million): \\[\\text{FPKM} = \\frac{\\text{Number of fragments mapped to a gene}}{\\text{Total fragments in sample} \\times 10^{-6}} \\times \\frac{10^3}{\\text{Length of gene in bp}}\\] For TPM, there are two steps: Calculate RPK (Reads Per Kilobase): \\[\\text{RPK} = \\frac{\\text{Number of reads mapped to a gene}}{\\text{Length of gene in kb}}\\] Calculate TPM (Transcripts Per Kilobase Million): \\[\\text{TPM} = \\frac{\\text{RPK for a gene} \\times 10^6}{\\text{Sum of all RPK values in the sample}}\\] when calculating TPM, the only difference is that you normalize for gene length first, and then normalize for sequencing depth second. However, the effects of this difference are quite profound. When you use TPM, the sum of all TPMs in each sample are the same. This makes it easier to compare the proportion of reads that mapped to a gene in each sample. In contrast, with RPKM and FPKM, the sum of the normalized reads in each sample may be different, and this makes it harder to compare samples directly. Examples and details Let’s try some examples from this blog. Example table: length 1000 bp 1200 bp 800 bp 500 bp 2000 bp sample A (count) 20 30 20 50 150 sample B (count) 100 60 140 120 180 Results (computed by claude): Transcript Length 1000 bp 1200 bp 800 bp 500 bp 2000 bp Total Sample A (Read Count) 20 30 20 50 150 270 FPKM (A) 74,074 92,593 92,593 370,370 277,778 907,408 TPM (A) 81,633 102,041 102,041 408,163 306,122 1,000,000 Sample B (Read Count) 100 60 140 120 180 600 FPKM (B) 166,667 83,333 291,667 400,000 150,000 1,091,667 TPM (B) 152,672 76,336 267,176 366,412 137,404 1,000,000 Why are FPKM and TPM different? Wagner, G.P., Kin, K. &amp; Lynch, V.J. Measurement of mRNA abundance using RNA-seq data: RPKM measure is inconsistent among samples. Theory Biosci. 131, 281–285 (2012). https://doi.org/10.1007/s12064-012-0162-3 The reason for the inconsistency of RPKM across samples arises from the normalization by the total number of reads. While rmc as well as qPCR results are ratios of transcript concentrations, the RPKM normalizes a proxy for transcript number by \\[\\frac{r_g \\cdot 10^3}{l_g \\cdot \\frac{R}{10^6}}\\] the number of sequencing reads in millions, \\[\\frac{R}{10^6}\\] The latter, however, is not a measure of total transcript number. The relationship between \\(R\\) and the total number of transcripts sampled depends on the size distribution of RNA transcripts, which can differ between samples. In a sample with, on average, longer transcripts the same number of reads represents fewer transcripts. While TPM is essentially the ratio of each gene’s RPK to the total RPK, RPKM (FPKM) can be considered as the ratio of each gene’s RPK to the total number of reads. When longer genes have more reads, the overall RPK effectively becomes smaller, resulting in a discrepancy in the total values."

RNA sequencing: the teenage years. Nat Rev Genet 20, 631–656 (2019). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41576-019-0150-2 Phase 1 — alignment/mapping of sequencing reads After sequencing has been completed, the starting point for analysis is the data files, which contain base-called sequencing reads, usually in the form of FASTQ files. The most common first step in processing these files is to map sequence reads to a known transcriptome (or annotated genome), converting each sequence read to one or more genomic coordinates. This process has traditionally been accomplished using distinct alignment tools, such as TopHat, STAR or HISAT, which rely on a reference genome. People typically call this first step, alignment or mapping. Long story in short, mapping means: Mostly we use reference genomes such as GRCh38 for the reference in mapping. In NCBI, SRA runs where the organism is Homo sapiens and type is Transcriptomic are aligned to genome assembly GCA_000001405.15 (link) using HISAT2. A. Bianchi, A. Di Marco and C. Pellegrini, “Comparing HISAT and STAR-based pipelines for RNA-Seq Data Analysis: a real experience,” 2023 IEEE 36th International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS), L’Aquila, Italy, 2023, pp. 218-224, doi: 10.1109/CBMS58004.2023.00220. The paper above describes two major mapping tools in RNA-Seq field, STAR and HISAT. HISAT2 uses graph FM index (GFM), has a smaller index size, is faster but has limited multi-threading capabilities, and is optimized for both single-end and paired-end reads. STAR2 uses Spliced Transcripts Alignment as a reference algorithm, has a larger index size, higher sensitivity, and better multi-threading, but it is slower, and it is optimized for spliced reads. Each algorithm creates distinct characteristics in mapping. It has been noted that different mapping tools can lead to variations in the identification of DEGs (differentially expressed genes). It is important to choose the appropriate tool based on one’s available computational resources, the volume of data to be processed, and the specific research objectives. DO NOT USE TopHat anymore even it was a legend Developers tweeted (maybe I should say ‘posted’) “Please stop using Tophat” multuiple times. https://x.com/lpachter/status/937055346987712512 https://x.com/lpachter/status/1762004715678957910 HISAT2 is the one you should use if you want to use Tophat-like mapping. Assembly of transcripts - why? Some analysis pipeline deploys StringTie as an assembler of transcripts. The main reason is this paper published on nature protocols. Pertea, M., Kim, D., Pertea, G. et al. Transcript-level expression analysis of RNA-seq experiments with HISAT, StringTie and Ballgown. Nat Protoc 11, 1650–1667 (2016). https://doi.org/10.1038/nprot.2016.095 Due to alternative splicing, a single gene can produce multiple types of transcripts. Therefore, when estimating gene expression levels from mapping results, you can decide whether you ignore transcript isoforms and counts per gene (gene-level quantification), or consider isoforms and count for each isoform separately (transcript-level quantification). De novo assembler such as StringTie makes isoform quantification possible. https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/stringtie/index.shtml?t=faq Phase 2 — quantification of transcript abundance Once reads have been mapped to genomic or transcriptomic locations, the next step in the analysis process is to assign them to genes or transcripts, to determine abundance measures. Diverse comparative studies have shown that the approach taken at the quantification step has perhaps the largest impact on the ultimate results, even greater than the choice of aligner. The quantification of read abundances for individual genes (that is, all transcript isoforms for that gene) relies on counting sequence reads that overlap known genes, using a transcriptome annotation. The next step is to count how many times genes are sequenced. Some methods are available here including HTSeq and RSEM. There are a couple of papers testing differences (The list below is a few examples). Chandramohan R, Wu PY, Phan JH, Wang MD. Benchmarking RNA-Seq quantification tools.

This GSE275240 is connected to another database called BioProject under PRJDB15620. BioProject contains SRA Run as sequence data and BioSample to explain what each sequence data is derived from. Certainly. SRA ‘Experiment’ describes the sequencing library derived from a specific sample and the sequencing method used. Much of the publicly available information about the data is recorded in the Experiment. SRA ‘Run’ is an object that groups together data files that should be linked to an Experiment. It contains little descriptive information about the data itself. All data files listed in a Run are merged into an SRA file for archiving (and into fastq files for distribution). Database structure This is an overall structure of SRA/BioSample/BioProject. The picture below is cited from DDBJ. Since it does not contain GEO, I just added in a mermaid plot.

DRA (DDBJ Sequence Read Archive) is an archive of raw read sequences and maintained by DDBJ. DRA (DDBJ Sequence Read Archive) is a member of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) and is operated in international cooperation with NCBI SRA and EBI Sequence Read Archive (ERA). The data is mirrored (synchronized). If you can find the same dataset in SRA and DRA, downloading from DRA is geographically much faster."

NCBI launched a new service to make the count matrix of RNA-Seq available! Count data generation occurs under the following conditions: 1. The sample is registered in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) 2. The sample is registered in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) 3. The sample is derived from either human or mouse A count matrix is automatically generated approximately one week after sample registration. For each GEO Series, two main types of files are generated, raw counts and normalized counts. RNA-seq Raw Count Matrix: Aspect Description Format Tab-delimited text file Purpose Suitable for input into differential expression analysis tools like DESeq2, edgeR, or limma voom Structure - First column: Gene IDs (matching the Human gene annotation table)- Remaining columns: Raw counts for each GEO Sample RNA-seq Normalized Count Matrix: Aspect Description Format Tab-delimited text file Purpose Suitable for qualitative analysis and visualization of gene expression abundance Structure - First column: Gene IDs (matching the Human gene annotation table)- Remaining columns: Normalized counts for each GEO Sample Normalization FPKM (RPKM) and TPM How does the analysis work? NCBI uses HISAT2 and featureCounts. Details are here. Briefly, SRA runs where the organism is Homo sapiens and type is Transcriptomic are aligned to genome assembly GCA_000001405.15 using HISAT2. Runs that pass a 50% alignment rate are further processed with Subread featureCounts which outputs a raw count file for each run. For Human data, the Homo sapiens Annotation Release 109.20190905 was used for gene annotation. GEO further processes these SRR raw count files into GEO Series raw counts matrices. Data derived from single cell samples are skipped. In cases where there is more than one SRA run per GEO Sample, the raw counts are summed. Values in the raw count matrices are rounded so that they are compatible input for common differential expression analysis software. Using the raw counts as input, GEO then computes FPKM(RPKM) and TPM normalized values. This way of the output is Atarimae (natural) in RNA-Seq field Please note that our in-house RNA-Seq pipeline provides the same format of results. You need to handle these data by yourself for data exploration anyway."
