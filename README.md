[This website: https://geedrn.github.io](https://geedrn.github.io) is for sharing markdown lab notes and my sandbox idea with others. 
I used a theme of gitbook forked from [here](https://github.com/sighingnow/jekyll-gitbook). jekyll-gitbook is deployed with Github Pages. Markdown files are automatically converted to HTML files locally and then push to Github repository.
